# dotfiles

## Overview

Welcome to my Dotfiles repository! This repository serves as a central hub for managing and sharing my personal configuration files (commonly known as "dotfiles") for various tools and applications. Dotfiles are used to customize and set up environments in Unix-like systems, including settings for shell, editors, and other tools.

# What are Dotfiles?

Dotfiles are plain text configuration files on Unix-like systems for things like our shell, ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile, ~/.vimrc, and many others. They are called "dotfiles" as they typically start with a dot (.), making them hidden files on Unix-based systems.
